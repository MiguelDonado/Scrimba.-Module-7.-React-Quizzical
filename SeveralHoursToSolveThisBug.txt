    /* 
    The attribute ID of INPUT element and the attribute HTMLFOR of LABEL has to be the same. 
    But its also ESSENTIAL that they must be UNIQUE through all the program.
    For instance:
    First question -> Answers ["Madrid","Barcelona","Sevilla","Valencia"]
    Second question -> Answers ["Zaragoza","Teruel","Vigo","Madrid"]
    At first, the value that i give to the id and htmlfor, was the answer itself (i.e. "Madrid" in that case).
    So in that case, if the same input appears on different questions, when i click on the label, its going to 
    trigger the first input with the id="Madrid" because the label has htmlFor="Madrid".
    But, this way i never could trigger the second input, because the htmlFor is linked to the first input with the same id.
    For that reason, i chose to concatenate the value with the id of the question, 
    to make the id and htmlFor of each answer UNIQUE
